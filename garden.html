  <ol> 
  <li>Choosing the best location: Pick a sport with good sun (5-8 hours of direct sunlight a day). Ensure that the area has soil drainage for watering.
</li>
  <li>Pick your plant: You can grow whatever you want but it's always nice to start a herb garden to give it little more purpose to. Consider what you enjoy eating and the climate you live in. You can research which plants grow best in your local climate. (Some easy crops:   tomatoes, herbs, cucumbers, kale, and peppers.)
 </li>
  <li>Prepare the soil: Soil quality is critical for healthy plant growth. Add rocks to the bottom of the pot if using to provide extra drainage. Turn the soil to loosen and removing any weeds from the area. </li>
        <li>Plant!: Follow the instructions on the seeds you have chosen. Then plant the seeds in rows, and leave space between each plant for proper growth. Gently water the seeds but not too much.  </li>
        <li>Maintain the garden: Water regularly and consistently according to seed package, (often once or twice a week) depending on your climate. Remove weeds that pop up and check for invasive bugs. Fertilize your plants if needed and harvest when ready!
 </li>
